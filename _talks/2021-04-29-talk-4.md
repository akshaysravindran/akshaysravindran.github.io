Are you an undergraduate or early-career graduate student that is seeking guidance on pursuing and preparing for a Ph.D. program? Don’t you wish you had that senior Ph.D. student to occasionally go to for help balancing everything? Then this event is for you! In association with the BRAIN center at the University of Houston, we are delighted to invite you to our panel discussion focusing on things you wish you knew before you started your Ph.D.

Entering a Ph.D. program can be daunting. Your graduate advisor can be a really great mentor, but sometimes, they don’t always have the same perspective as you, a student. The aim behind this event is to encourage those who are about to enter or have recently entered the Ph.D. program to seek guidance from more senior students who have experienced the challenges of balancing research, courses, work, and home lives. Our panelists are current University of Houston Ph.D. candidates. They will discuss some of the most important things to keep in mind when starting your Ph.D., including staying organized, writing/submitting publications, preparing for qualifying exams/dissertations, and much more!

We are excited to have a diverse and experienced set of alumni with us to discuss their Ph.D. journeys and answer your questions:

Akshay Ravindran (Department of Electrical Engineering)
Alex Craik (Department of Electrical Engineering)
Sydnee Spruiell (Department of Biology and Biochemistry)
<br>

Target audience: People who are planning to start or in the early stages of the doctoral degree
