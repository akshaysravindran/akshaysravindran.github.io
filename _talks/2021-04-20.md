A collaboration with Artist-in-Residence at the Cullen College of Engineering Geraldina Interiano Wise, Rice'83, '85 in Architecture and Art. 
The Nahual, which in Maya cosmology refers to a mirror spirit assigned to each person at birth, is a live painting performance in a closed loop of the brain, during which Geraldina wears a Brain-Computer Interface that captures her brain waves during the creative process in real-time, which trigger the GAN model trained in her art.The GAN model creates a digital painting triggerd by the artist's EEG while the artist create a physical painting. The brain waves also trigger a grammar of sound (created in collaboration with composer Amos Cochran),  towards the sonification of the brain. 

Here we demonstrate the first version of the GAN based Nahual demonstration by the UHBMI team led by Dr. Jose Contreras-Vidal. More details about the project is available in the project website
