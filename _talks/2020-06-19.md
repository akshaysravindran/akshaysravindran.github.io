Scope: Introductory (High School - UG, Introductory Level)<br>
Target audience: People with a good understanding of what EEG is and how to process them, but are new to using CNN or explainability of such models in their research. Should have basic coding proficiency in Python and Keras.

Event: BRAIN Center Summer Workshop Series
  
  
<br>
In this video, I introduce three separate methods to explains what a convolutional neural network (CNN) has learned when it is used to study EEG. The scope of the video is introductory with an aim to help you get started on using CNN for decoding purposes and motivate the use of explanations to debug the model better. I will walk you through the code in google colab to implement them in Python.
