In this video, I introduce some of the typical preprocessing stages for artifact handling in EEG data. The scope of the video is not to explain in detail each individual step. It will be limited to giving motivation as to why we perform each of the steps in general and then walking you through the code to implement them using EEGLab in Matlab. The aim is to help you get started on analyzing EEG data. The workshop is part of the 2020 Summer Workshop Series on EEG analysis, organized by the UH BRAIN Center student group. 
<br>
Scope: Introductory<br>
Target audience: People with a basic understanding of what EEG is, but are new to the analysis. Should have basic coding proficiency in Matlab.

Event: BRAIN Center Summer Workshop Series
