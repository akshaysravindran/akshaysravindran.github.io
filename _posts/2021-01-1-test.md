Weekend random thoughts on practices/views I wished we emphasized more as a community. Sharing in case someone benefits
<br/>
1) Passion is critical in life as it makes the journey fun, but realize that your passion is also limited to things you are exposed to. So it is ok for it to evolve with time. Explore many things early in your career & let your passion drive the journey
<br/>
2) Exposure is key & plays a huge part in you succeeding at things. If you are first in your family at doing something, it will be harder for you. You might not have the right contact or info at the right time. Your journey is unique, so work on that. Dont be disheartened by someone else's success
<br/>
3) Normalize failures & encourage growth from them. Realize that the faster you fail at something, the quicker you will learn to master that situation. Let's strive to develop an environment that allows people to become vulnerable & face their fears
<br/>
4) There will always be people who are better than you & that's ok. Know that it is a process, & have a larger vision. At each moment, take the next step in the direction that gets you closer to realizing it & enjoy the journey
<br/>
5) Schools shifts their focus from training us to be better test-takers to creating an environment that promotes us to be curious & collaborative
