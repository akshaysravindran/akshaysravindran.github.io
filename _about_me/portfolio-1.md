title: "Akshay Sujatha Ravindran"
excerpt: "I am a doctoral candidate at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Houston. Under the supervision of Dr. Jose Contreras Vidal, I work in the Non-Invasive Brain-Machine Interface Systems Lab as part of the BRAIN Center (NSF IUCRC). My research focuses on developing different engineering tools for analyzing non-invasive electrophysiological data, mainly involving EEG. My expertise lies in developing deep learning models to study the EEG, with significant emphasis on explainability of such models. I also strongly believe that deep learning is not the answer to all questions and many questions are best answered by classical signal processing and machine learning approaches.

I have a diverse portfolio of projects covering areas such as:
a) Brain-computer interface systems: predicting balance perturbation, lower limb kinematics, and decoding hand motor imagery from EEG
b) Exploring the feasibility of studying the brain in real-world settings (using museums and public venues as a laboratory)
c) Changes in EEG associated meditation
d) Developing synergistic activities between arts and science to promote interdisciplinary research opportunities while also serving as outreach activities in STEM.
Before joining the University of Houston for my doctoral studies, I worked at Health Technology Innovation Center at the IIT Madras, India as a Research Intern for a year. During that time I worked on developing wearable vital signal monitoring devices. I earned my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from the University of Kerala, India in 2015

Outside of research,  I value teaching and mentoring significantly and I find satisfaction the most when I get to help someone advance their career and dreams. I feel very blessed and happy to be in a profession that provides incentives for lifelong learning and offers great flexibility to pursue things that spark your curiosity and interest. Outside of work, I love to travel, spend quality time in nature, meditate, yoga, go for walks, play and watch soccer and most importantly am a huge foodie! I love to engage in conversations and activities related to spirituality, developing a growth mindset, and overcoming failures/challenges."
