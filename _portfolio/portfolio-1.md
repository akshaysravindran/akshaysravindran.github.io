* **Estimating blood oxygen saturation using custom wearable device <br>
  A wrist worn device with a custom finger probe assembly which can continuously measure SpO2 by eliminating motion artifacts using accelerometer data was developed. The accuracy of the device in measuring SpO2 values in the range 80-100 was validated using a Fluke ProSim 8 SpO2 simulator. The efficiency in eliminating motion corrupted signals was also validated in a controlled setting on 40 healthy volunteers.
