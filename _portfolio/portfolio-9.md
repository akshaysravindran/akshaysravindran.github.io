# Summary
In this project, we explored the possibility and challenges
associated with conducting experiments with children in a
stimulating complex public environment. We also explored
the feasibility of using deep learning techniques to help identify
relevant patterns of brain activity associated with different
conditions: rest versus video game play, and male versus
female. This approach could be an efficient tool to be used
in studies to uncover patterns from electrophysiological data. We also investigated the age-related changes in spectral features
in EEG in the temporo-parietal channels. Similar to prior
research work, we observed that absolute power decreased
with age in all frequency bands, particularly in the slower
frequency bands. The general trend observed in
this study were again in agreement with prior research, which
associates the reduction in slow wave activity with the reduction
in gray matter as we develop/mature. The relative
power had a trend of correlating negatively with age for
delta and theta bands while the faster bands like alpha and
beta correlated positively with age. This trend is
consistent with what is observed in previous studies in laboratory environment. However
only the theta band in TP9 was found to be statistically significant
in our analysis. Overall, the current
study contributes to a better understanding of how deep
learning can be used as a data driven approach to identify patterns
in your data and explored the issues and the potential
of conducting experiments involving children in a natural
and engaging environment.
