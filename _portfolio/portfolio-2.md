#Summary
Recognizing human emotion from heartbeat information
alone is a challenging but ongoing research area. Here,
we utilize a Point Process model based on History Dependent Inverse Gaussian (HDIG), optimized using maximum likelihood estimation and Bayesian information criterion 
was used to characterize RR-intervals and generate instantaneous HRV features. We were then able to distinguish between high and low levels of valence, dominance and
 arousal using only heartbeat dynamics based on a convolutional neural network model. On average, we achieved over 60%
classification accuracy and as high as 77% in some subjects.
This is comparable to other studies that use a combination
of physiological signals as opposed to only HRV measures as
done here. Informative features were identified for the different
affective states. These findings enable the possibility of augmenting
electrocardiogram or photoplethysmogram monitoring
wearable devices with automated human emotion recognition
capabilities for mental health applications. They also allow for
the use of instantaneous estimation of HRV features to be used
in combination with models that use other types of physiological
signals for instantaneous emotion recognition.
