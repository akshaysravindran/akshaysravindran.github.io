======
I am a doctoral candidate at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Houston. Under the supervision of Dr. Jose Contreras Vidal, I work in the non-invasive brain machine interface systems lab as part of the BRAIN center (NSF IUCRC). Broadly my research involves developing different engineering tools for extracting patterns from electrophysiological data. My main expertise lies in developing deep learning models to study the EEG, with emphasis on explinability of such models. I have a diverse portfolio of projects including developing a) brain computer interface systems for predicting balance perturbation, prediction of lower limb kinematics, and decoding hand motor imagery; b) multiple project that explore the feasibility of studying the brain in real-world settings (using museums and public venues as a laboratory); c) effects of meditation on EEG; d) developing synergies between arts and science as a means to develop outreach activities in STEM while promoting interdisciplinary research opportunities. 

Prior to joining the University of Houston for my doctoral studies, I worked at Health Technology Innovation Center at the IIT Madras, India as a Research Intern for an year. During that time I worked on developing wearable vital signal monitoring devices. I earned my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from the University of Kerala, India in 2015.


If you want to know a bit more about me
======
I value teaching and mentoring significantly and I find satisfaction the most when I get to help someone advance their career and dreams or if I get to inspire someone to do something more with their life. I feel very blessed and happy to be in a profession that provides and incentives for lifelong learning and great flexibility to pursue things that spark your curiosity and interest. Outside of work, I love to travel, spend quality quiet time in nature, meditate, go for walks, play and watch soccer and having different food! I love to engage in conversations and activities related to spirituality, developing growth mindset and overcoming failures/challenges.
