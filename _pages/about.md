Welcome to my personal webpage. It's still a work in progress so bear with me...

I am currently a postdoctoral fellow in the [Kording Lab](http://kordinglab.com/) at University of Pennsylvania. I am broadly interested in studying complex natural and functional human movement in healthy individuals and those with movement disorders with the goal of developing better strategies for restoring lost function. In particular, I am interested draw from theories and techniques in movement science, neuroscience, artificial intelligence, to rethink the way we study movement and the brain.  

I recently recieved my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Houston in Houston, TX working in the lab of Dr. Contreras-Vidal ([UHBMIST](https://www.facebook.com/UHBMIST)). During my Ph.D., I was awarded the [NIH Blueprint Diversity Specialized Predoctoral to Postdoctoral Advancement in Neuroscience (D-SPAN) Award (F99/K00)](https://neuroscienceblueprint.nih.gov/nih-blueprint-d-span-award-f99k00). I was primarily focused on developing a non-invasive neural interface for control of robotic prosthetic devices by individuals with limb amputation. I utilized numerous recording modalities to extract signals from the brain (EEG), muscles (EMG), and movement (motion capture) during walking and other limb movements--for example, see [this article](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2018133) in Scientific Data, which summarizes our experminetal approach. For my dissertation, I developed a real-time noninvasive brain-machine interface for control of a powered-leg prosthesis by above-the-knee amputees. A number of publications detailing this work are still in preparation. 

Check out my [CV](https://jabrantley.github.io/files/JustinBrantley_Modern_CV.pdf) for some more details on my previous work.
