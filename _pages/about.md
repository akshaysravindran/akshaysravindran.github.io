I am a doctoral candidate at the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Houston. Under the supervision of Dr. Jose Contreras Vidal, I work in the Non-Invasive Brain-Machine Interface Systems Lab as part of the BRAIN Center (NSF IUCRC). My research focuses on developing different engineering tools for analyzing non-invasive electrophysiological data, mainly involving EEG. My expertise lies in developing deep learning models to study the EEG, with significant emphasis on explainability of such models. I also strongly believe that deep learning is not the answer to all questions and many questions are best answered by classical signal processing and machine learning approaches. 

<br />
I have a diverse portfolio of projects covering areas such as: <br />a) Brain-computer interface systems: predicting balance perturbation, lower limb kinematics, and decoding hand motor imagery from EEG <br /> b) Exploring the feasibility of studying the brain in real-world settings (using museums and public venues as a laboratory) <br /> c) Changes in EEG associated meditation <br /> d) Developing synergistic activities between arts and science to promote interdisciplinary research opportunities while also serving as outreach activities in STEM. 
<br />
Before joining the University of Houston for my doctoral studies, I worked at Health Technology Innovation Center at the IIT Madras, India as a Research Intern for a year. During that time I worked on developing wearable vital signal monitoring devices. I earned my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from the University of Kerala, India in 2015.

If you want to know a bit more about me
======
I value teaching and mentoring significantly and I find satisfaction the most when I get to help someone advance their career and dreams. I feel very blessed and happy to be in a profession that provides incentives for lifelong learning and offers great flexibility to pursue things that spark your curiosity and interest. Outside of work, I love to travel, spend quality time in nature, meditate, yoga, go for walks, play and watch soccer and most importantly am a huge foodie! I love to engage in conversations and activities related to spirituality, developing a growth mindset, and overcoming failures/challenges.
