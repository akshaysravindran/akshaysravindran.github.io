## Biosketch
<p style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:14pt; font-style:normal">
  
I am a doctoral candidate in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the <span style="color:IndianRed ">University of Houston</span>. Under the supervision of <span style="color:IndianRed  ">Dr. Jose Contreras Vidal</span>, I work in the Non-Invasive Brain-Machine Interface Systems Lab (BRAIN Center). I am a science enthusiast fascinated by how our human body manages the sophisticated behavior and capabilities so effortlessly. My research focuses on developing different engineering tools for analyzing non-invasive electrophysiological data. My expertise lies in developing  <span style="color:IndianRed  ">deep learning</span>  models to study the EEG, with an emphasis on <span style="color:IndianRed">explainability</span> of such models. Even though most of my research currently uses deep learning models, I strongly believe that many questions are best answered by <span style="color:IndianRed  ">classical signal processing</span> and  <span style="color:IndianRed  ">machine learning approaches</span> and one should be open to the values in both.

In the UHBMI lab, I was fortunate to have the experience of working in a diverse portfolio of projects covering areas such as:<br/>
a) Brain-computer interface systems using EEG: i) predicting balance perturbation, ii) decoding lower limb kinematics, and iii) decoding hand motor imagery.<br/>
b) Exploring the feasibility of studying the brain in real-world settings (using museums and public venues as a laboratory).<br/>
c) Changes in EEG associated meditation practice.<br/>
d) Developing synergistic activities/projects between arts and science to promote interdisciplinary research opportunities while also serving as outreach activities in STEM.<br/>
e) Point process characterization of heartbeat dynamics measured using Photoplethysmography <br/>
<br/>
<br/> 
Before joining the University of Houston for my doctoral studies, I worked at Health Technology Innovation Center at the <span style="color:IndianRed ">IIT Madras</span>, India as a Research Intern for a year. During that time I worked on developing <span style="color:IndianRed ">wearable vital signal monitoring</span> devices. I earned my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from the TKM College of Engineering, <span style="color:IndianRed ">University of Kerala</span>, India in 2015.

## What are my values and hobbies

<p style="font-family: Garamond; font-size:14pt; font-style:normal">

Outside of research,  I value teaching and <span style="color:IndianRed ">mentoring</span>  significantly and I find satisfaction the most when I get to help someone advance their career and dreams. I feel very blessed and happy to be in a profession that provides incentives for <span style="color:IndianRed ">lifelong learning</span> and offers great flexibility to pursue things that spark your curiosity and interest. Outside of work, I love to travel, spend quality time in nature, meditate, play and watch soccer (huge arsenal fan since 2006), do yoga, go for casual walks/biking and most importantly I am a huge foodie! I love to engage in conversations and activities related to spirituality, interoception for health and wellbeing, developing a <span style="color:IndianRed ">growth mindset</span>, and overcoming failures/challenges. I am an agnostic person with a slight bias towards athiestic line of thoughts but as with my general perspective on topics, I am open to be convinced otherwise.
